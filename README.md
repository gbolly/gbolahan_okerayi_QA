### Aim
UI automation test to cover basic negative test scenario.

### Language
- ``Python``

### Tools
- ``Pytest``
- ``Selenium/Selenium webdriver``

Pytest helps us cover unit test, functional test, acceptance tests, generates report and has good support hence the choice and it's combination with Selenium WebDriver does not also involve a steep learning curve.

With Pytest fixtures, it helps the test automation scale eventually since it is not good practise to always load new instance of the browser after each test (i.e it is much better to load a browser before all tests and then close it after all tests are executed) which in turn saves us resource and execution time.
